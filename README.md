# E-Commerce Project  

This is a MERN stack-based eCommerce application built as part of a learning project.  

## Milestone 1: Project Overview  
Learning Goals  
- Understand the MERN stack structure  
- Learn how eCommerce applications work  
- Set up the GitHub repository for this project  

Features Planned  
- User authentication (Login & Register)  
- Product listing & management  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- Secure checkout system  

 Repository Structure  
- **Backend (Node.js & Express)** → Handles API requests and database interactions  
- **Frontend (React.js)** → Displays products and user interactions  
- **Database (MongoDB)** → Stores products, users, and orders  

## Milestone 2: Frontend & Login Page  
- Set up the React frontend using `create-react-app`.  
- Built the login page with proper styling using regular CSS.  
- Ensured the UI is responsive and user-friendly.  
 
 ##  Milestone 3: Backend Setup & Database Connection  
- Structured the backend with separate folders for models, routes, controllers, and middleware.  
- Set up an Express.js server and made it listen on `PORT 5000`.  
- Connected the backend to MongoDB for data storage.  
- Implemented basic error handling to improve debugging and stability.  
 
  ##  Milestone 4: User Model, Controller & File Uploads  
- Created a **User Model** to define how user data is stored in MongoDB.  
- Implemented a **User Controller** to manage user-related operations (like registration and fetching user data).  
- Configured **Multer** for handling file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).  
- Updated the **README** file with Milestone 4 progress.  

## Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page
- Created a Sign-Up Page with fields for name, email, and password.
- Implemented form validation to ensure correct inputs.
- Styled the page using CSS for a clean and user-friendly design.

## Milestone 6: Secure Signup Backend
- Created a backend endpoint for user signup.
- Implemented bcrypt to encrypt passwords before storing them in the database.
- Stored user data securely in MongoDB.

## Milestone 7: User Login Backend
- In this milestone, I implemented the backend functionality for user login. The key achievements include:
- Created a login route to authenticate users.
- Validated user credentials by checking if the email exists in the database.
- Used bcrypt to compare the hashed password with the user’s input.
- Generated a JWT token upon successful authentication.
- Handled errors for incorrect login details.
